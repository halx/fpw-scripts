This is a conversion of Jim Breen's ENAMDICT[1] to JIS X 4081 format (an EPWING subset[2]) by Hannes Loeffler <hal@hloeffler.info>.  The code of the conversion script is based on work by Kazuhiko Shiozaki[3] using the FreePWING library[4].


The dictionary can be searched in the following ways.

* by kanji: the reading will be given in romaji and codes explaining the name are displayed
* by romaji: the kanji/kana name will be displayed
* by kana: kana only names will be displayed including katakana foreign names, search by kanji reading is only possible via romaji


The codes have the following meaning:

s  - family or surname
m  - male given name or forename
f  - female given name or forename
g  - given name or forename, gender not specified
u  - unclassified name
p  - full name of a particular person
