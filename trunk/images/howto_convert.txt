In order to obtain bitmaps for each character from a TTF font do the following.

1) Convert with e.g. otf2bdf or ttf2bdf:

   e.g. otf2bdf -o kochi.bdf -p 64 kochi-mincho-subst.ttf

2) Change the encoding to JIS X 0208 with e.g. FontForge (formerly pfaEdit)

3) extract bitmap characters with bdf2xbm (note: complains a lot in the current
   form but output is ok), file names according to JIS X 0208 encoding

4) convert from XBM to BMP with ImageMagicks's convert
